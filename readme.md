#### Staring Config

Open a new VS Code window. Create a folder called 'AWS_STATIC_SITE'

Run 'npm init -y' to create a package.json a your project.  
Add the "type": "module" key and value to the bottom of the package.json file.  
This is so we can work with modern javascript import synthax

Initialise a git repo using the 'git init' command

Run 'aws configure'. Fill in your  
AWS Access Key ID,  
AWS Secret Access Key,  
AWS Default region name,  
Default output format should be 'json'.

Install dotenv by running 'npm install dotenv'

Create file called '.env' in the root folder with the following info, remove the
curly braces! The bucket name must be unique across the aws service!  
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID={AWS ACCOUNT ID HERE}  
AWS_IAM_USER={AWS IAM USER_NAME_HERE}  
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={AWS ACCESS KEY HERE}  
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ID={AWS SECRET ACCESS KEYHERE}  
AWS_BUCKET_NAME={AWS BUCKET NAME HERE} The AWS_BUCKET_NAME must be url firendly.
I sguggest using lower case letters and dashes only.

Add a file called '.gitignore'  
add 'node_modules/' and '.env' to your git ignore file on separate lines

Run 'npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3'

#### Add Html File for static site

Add a folder in the root called assets. This will be the folder in which we
store our static site.

Add a file inside the assets folder called index.html. Add the following html to
your file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website Home Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>Now hosted on Amazon S3!</p>
  </body>
</html>
